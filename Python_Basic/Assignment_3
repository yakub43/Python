1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?
--> Functions are can be very useful while doing coding/Programming
    as it will help to reduce coding line by not writing redundant code
    Our program will look neat and clean as we are not repeating
    same statement again and again.
   
2. When does the code in a function run: when it's specified or when it's called?
--> When we called the function at that time the function body is run.

3. What statement creates a function?
--> the def keyword is used the define/create a function.
    if u just create a function without a body it can show error
    so one can write pass in the body.

4. What is the difference between a function and a function call?
--> Function is the set of statements which will do specific task.
    But when we call a function the function will execute the statement
    written in function body.
    
5. How many global scopes are there in a Python program? How many local scopes?
--> In python there is only one global scope per program.
    In local scopes if variable or function defined inside a
    function it's scope will only local scope means we can't be 
    able to see that varaible outside of that function. in local
    scope python will search for first Local scope->global->builtin
  
6. What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns?
--> The return will statement will return the value from the function i.e. 
    after manipulating/executing the statement inside the body of function
    at last we will get that manipulated value from function with the help
    of return statement.
    
7. What is the concept of a return value? Is it possible to have a return value in an expression?
