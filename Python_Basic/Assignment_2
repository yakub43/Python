1.What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?
In boolean we have two values which are true and false.

2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?
We have OR , AND and NOT boolean operator because this operators will return true and false values.
lets see each operator here A and B is input, C is Output.
OR boolean operator -> this operator will return true if any one input is true

A  B   C
0  0   0
0  1   1
1  0   1
1  1   1

AND Boolean Operator -> this operator will return only true when every input is true oterwise it will return false.
A  B   C
0  0   0
0  1   0
1  0   0
1  1   1

NOT Boolean Operator -> This operator will coplement the input if it is true it will false vice versa.
A   C
0   1
1   0

3. Make a list of each Boolean operator's truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean
values for the operator and what it evaluate ).
OR boolean operator -> this operator will return true if any one input is true

A  B   C
0  0   0
0  1   1
1  0   1
1  1   1

AND Boolean Operator -> this operator will return only true when every input is true oterwise it will return false.
A  B   C
0  0   0
0  1   0
1  0   0
1  1   1

NOT Boolean Operator -> This operator will coplement the input if it is true it will false vice versa.
A   C
0   1
1   0

4. What are the values of the following expressions?
(5 > 4) and (3 == 5) -> False
not (5 > 4)  -> False
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5) -> True
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5)) -> False
(True and True) and (True == False) -> False
(not False) or (not True) -> True

5. What are the six comparison operators?
i) == Equals operator this operator will compare values from both side.
   5 == 5 -> this will return True
   5 == 4 -> this will return False
ii) > Greater than Operator, This operator will compare the left side value with right side value.
    10 > 5 -> This will return True
    10 < 20 -> This will return False
iii) < less Than Operator, This opeartor will compare left side value with right side value.
    6 < 8 -> This will return True
    8 < 10 -> This will return False
iv) <= Less Than Equal to , This opeartor will check if left side value is less than or equal to the right side value
    4 <= 3 -> This will return false
    6 <= 10 -> This will return True
    8 <= 8 -> This will return True
v) >= Greater than equal to, This operator will check if left side value is greater than or equal to right side value.
   5 >= 10 -> This will return False
   7 >= 4 -> This will return True
   6 >= 6 -> This will return True
vi) != Not Equal to, This operator will check if the values are equal to or not
    7 != 6 -> This will return True
    8 != 8 -> This will return False
    
6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a
condition and when you would use one.
Assignment(=) operator is used to assgin a value to the variable
But in equal to operator (==) we are comparing left side value with right side value.
If I just want to initialize a variable with any value i Will use Assignment operator. -> num = 10
If I want to compare thw two values i will use equal to operator. -> 10 == 10

7. Identify the three blocks in this code:
As we know pyhton is indentaion sensitive language we should take care of this while writing code.
spam = 0
if spam == 10:   ----> Firts Block
print('eggs') 
if spam > 5:    -----> Second Block
print('bacon')  
else:           -------> Third Block
print('ham')   
print('spam')
print('spam')

8. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints
Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.

spam = 1
if (spam == 1):
   print("Hello")
elif (spam == 2):
   print("Howdy")
else:
   print("Greetings!")

9.If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys youâ€™ll press?
Ctr + C

10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?
Break ->
      When we want to come out of loop use Break.
      This will break the current loop and we come out of loop.
Continue -> 
       When we want skip next line after continue statement at specific condition use Continue.
 
11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?
range(10) -> This will print 10 numbers 0 to 9.
range(0,10) -> Here we have give starting index from where we want to start 0 to end at 10 , This will also print 0 to 9 total 10 numbers.
range(0,10,1) -> Here we have give starting index, last index, and steps means how much steps to do , this will print 0 to 9 total 10 numbers.

12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent
program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.
for loop ->
          for i in range(1,11):
             print(i)
             
while loop ->
          num = 1
          while(num < 11):
             print(num)
             num += 1

13. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after
importing spam?
spam.bacon()
