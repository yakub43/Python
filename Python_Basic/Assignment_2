1.What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?
In boolean we have two values which are true and false.

2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?
We have OR , AND and NOT boolean operator because this operators will return true and false values.
lets see each operator here A and B is input, C is Output.
OR boolean operator -> this operator will return true if any one input is true

A  B   C
0  0   0
0  1   1
1  0   1
1  1   1

AND Boolean Operator -> this operator will return only true when every input is true oterwise it will return false.
A  B   C
0  0   0
0  1   0
1  0   0
1  1   1

NOT Boolean Operator -> This operator will coplement the input if it is true it will false vice versa.
A   C
0   1
1   0

3. Make a list of each Boolean operator's truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean
values for the operator and what it evaluate ).
OR boolean operator -> this operator will return true if any one input is true

A  B   C
0  0   0
0  1   1
1  0   1
1  1   1

AND Boolean Operator -> this operator will return only true when every input is true oterwise it will return false.
A  B   C
0  0   0
0  1   0
1  0   0
1  1   1

NOT Boolean Operator -> This operator will coplement the input if it is true it will false vice versa.
A   C
0   1
1   0

4. What are the values of the following expressions?
(5 > 4) and (3 == 5) -> False
not (5 > 4)  -> False
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5) -> True
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5)) -> False
(True and True) and (True == False) -> False
(not False) or (not True) -> True

5. What are the six comparison operators?
i) == Equals operator this operator will compare values from both side.
   5 == 5 -> this will return True
   5 == 4 -> this will return False
ii) > Greater than Operator, This operator will compare the left side value with right side value.
    10 > 5 -> This will return True
    10 < 20 -> This will return False
iii) < less Than Operator, This opeartor will compare left side value with right side value.
    6 < 8 -> This will return True
    8 < 10 -> This will return False
iv) <= Less Than Equal to , This opeartor will check if left side value is less than or equal to the right side value
    4 <= 3 -> This will return false
    6 <= 10 -> This will return True
    8 <= 8 -> This will return True
v) >= Greater than equal to, This operator will check if left side value is greater than or equal to right side value.
   5 >= 10 -> This will return False
   7 >= 4 -> This will return True
   6 >= 6 -> This will return True
vi) != Not Equal to, This operator will check if the values are equal to or not
    7 != 6 -> This will return True
    8 != 8 -> This will return False
    
6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a
condition and when you would use one.
