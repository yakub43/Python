1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be
integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.

*        -> Multiplication operator
'hello'  -> String type
-87.8    -> Float value
-        -> Subtraction operator
/        -> Divide operator
+        -> Addition Operator
6        -> Integer

2. What is the difference between string and variable?

String -> It is object in the python.                              Variable -> Variable is dynamic.
          It has methods associated with the String type.                      It can have type of what user has assign to it.
          User can perform manipulation with the help of String.               There is proper nomenclature which user must follow while declaring variable.
          
 3. Describe three different data types.
  
  String -> this data types is used to store the characters/String.
            String has inbuilt methods.
            With the help of methods one can perform tasks.
  
  Integer -> Integer is used to store the Integer value.
             with the help of this we can perform mathematical operation.
             
 Boolean -> Boolean is used to store true or false value.
 
 4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?
 Expression is made up of different Operator within the statement and it is used to do some specific task.
 Expression can do manipulation , update or delete the data.
 
 5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an
expression and a statement?
Assignment operator is assigning the value to the variable here, spam is variable which assign integer value of 10.
Assignment operator is assigning the value to the variable, but the expression will maipulate the variable.

6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?
bacon = 22
bacon + 1

In the very first statement we are assigning the value to bacon variable with integer value of  22.
After running the second statement we increment the bacon by 1 i.e. bacon = 22 + 1
after this bacon value will update to 23 from 22.

7. What should the values of the following two terms be?
'spam' + 'spamspam'
'spam'* 3

Both the statements output will be same but the expression is different first one is using string concatenation while second is using string multiplication.
'spam' + 'spamspam' -> spamspamspam
'spam'*3 -> spamspamspam

8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?
In the pyton we must have to follow some rules while defining any variable, So as per rules we cannot initialize variable name with numbers.

9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string
version of a value?
for integer we use int() function.
for floating-point number we use float() function
for string we use str()

10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?
'I have eaten '+ 99 + ' burritos.'

As per concatination we must use same type of data types in this expression we try to concat string value with integer value.
we can fix this error by converting 99 to string.
'I have eaten '+ '99' + ' burritos.'
